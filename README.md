# Analysis of the Vine Program

## Overview
The purpose of the Vine Program analysis, in addition to providing the total number of paid and unpaid reviews and the detail of each review in the video game database, is to assist in analyzing the quality of data and its usability.

## Results
* There are a total of 1,757 vine reviews and 572,411 non vine reviews in the video game database.<br />
* There are a total of 291,835 5-star-reviews, 291,135 of them are non-vine.<br />
* 39.84% of vine reviews are 5 stars, whereas 50.86% of the non-Vine reviews are 5 stars.<br />

## Summary
5 star reviews account for almost 40% of total Vine reviews. In my opinion, the percentage is not large enough to support a positivity bias. To futher support my statement, I could measure the percentage of positive reviews versus total reviews. If the percentage of positive reviews in the vine program significantly exceeds the positive percentage in total reviews, then there may be a bias.
